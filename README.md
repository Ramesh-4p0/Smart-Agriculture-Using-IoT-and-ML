# Mini-Project - Smart Agriculture Robot

## Introduction

Welcome to the Smart Agriculture Robot project! This project focuses on leveraging technology to enhance agricultural practices, improving productivity, reducing waste, and optimizing various farming processes. The team members include Mohammed Mudassir, Ramesh G, Rohith V, and Janhvi Kumari, guided by Professor Syeda Husna Mohammadi, Assistant Professor in the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at HKBK College of Engineering.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a versatile robot capable of automating key agricultural processes such as health detection, plowing, sowing, and irrigation. Through the integration of cutting-edge technologies such as machine learning, IoT, and robotics, we aim to empower farmers with a comprehensive solution that facilitates informed decision-making to enhance crop yield and quality.

## Problem Statement

Traditional farming methods often lack precision, leading to challenges such as low crop yield, poor quality, and inefficient resource utilization. This project addresses these issues by introducing a smart agriculture solution that provides precise monitoring, disease detection, and effective irrigation management.

## Components Required

- Raspberry Pi
- Arduino UNO
- NodeMCU (esp8266)
- Camera
- Robot
- Servo Motor
- Sensors
- Machine Learning (for disease detection)
- Python, Arduino IDE, Android Studio (for software development)

## Project Modes

### Mode 1: Automation of Farming Processes

This mode involves the development of a prototype robot equipped with a control panel for monitoring and remotely controlling the movement and performing plowing and sowing operations.

### Mode 2: Disease Detection and Solution Recommendation

In this mode, the robot captures images of plant's leafes, which are analyzed by a machine learning model to detect whether the leaf is healthy or not.

## Results

The project showcases successful results, including a control panel for monitoring, sowing and plowing capabilities, and real-time disease detection with high accuracy.

## Methodology

The development process includes the creation of a prototype robot, integration of plowing and sowing machinery, connection to a server, and the development of a website/app for remote control. Disease detection involves capturing images, machine learning analysis, solution recommendation, data storage, and app development.
